### I'm Tanner
A recent Graduate from Colorado College with a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science. In academia, I studied database management, programming language implementation, networking, and natural language processing. I spent a summer as a research assistant, training natural language models in entity recognition and relation extraction on randomized clinical trials. 

Currently working on a iOS social media platform called Personally, release to the app store coming soon. Please reach out with ANY questions about this project!

Looking ahead, I'm going to pursue a career in data science.
